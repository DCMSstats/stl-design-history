## What is a service blueprint?

A service blueprint provides a comprehensive overview of how a service and its related experience are delivered, end-to-end, front-to-back, and across various channels.

It is a diagram that visualises the relationships between different service components, including people, physical/digital evidence encountered by users, and processes directly tied to steps in a specific user journey.

It builds on a user journey map (which visualises a user's experience when using a service), adding the 'frontstage' and 'backstage' people and processes involved in delivering that service to the user, as well as internal supporting processes.

## Why do we need a service blueprint?

- It assists in understanding the various aspects of a service, such as service administration, offline parts of the journey, and offline users.
- It serves as a valuable basis for discussions with potential service owners/operators.
- We need to consider solving a whole problem for users, and providing a joined up experience across different channels. Mapping the entire service, along with connected services, helps identify all potential touchpoints and their necessary interactions.

## Evolution of the Short-Term Lets Register Service Blueprint

Throughout this Alpha phase we have been iterating on the service blueprint during collaborative workshops, as well as weekly blueprint updates with members of the team, to facilitate ongoing discussions and inform decision-making.

### Initial draft

We started by creating an initial draft based on insights from discovery, early user testing, and assumptions about the service's functionality.

This draft was divided into three main phases: pre-registration, registration, and post-registration.

Each phase was further broken down into subphases. We included user actions, online/offline interactions, and potential processes for various stakeholders.

### Version 1

During the first workshop in Sprint 2, we discussed the pre-registration and registration phases in detail.

Key points included:

- The importance of stakeholder involvement in raising awareness among users about the new regulations and their responsibilities.
- The potential need for a "Becoming Compliant" stage before registration, and identified potential delays in the registration process due to compliance requirements.
- Gaps in the assisted digital journey and the potential need for an internal portal.
- The possibility of a phased rollout approach to mitigate risks and ensure a smooth transition

### Version 2

Throughout Sprint 2, we continued refining the service blueprint by:

- Adding new sub-phases for 'Becoming Compliant' and ‘Validation’ to reflect previous discussions.
- Incorporated new insights from stakeholders, including booking platforms, Visit England, the Scottish Government, and other government departments (OGDs). These insights covered areas such as awareness-raising, data usage, and potential challenges with compliance and registration validation.

During our 2nd Blueprinting Workshop, we concentrated on the 'Registration' phase:

- We discussed the user journey on GOV.UK
- Explored assisted digital and offline options
- Discussed the complexities of compliance validation and enforcement

These discussions highlighted the need for a simplified blueprint to facilitate stakeholder communication and address questions around service ownership and administration.

### Version 3

Between Sprints 2 and 3, we developed a simplified "1-minute" version of the blueprint to facilitate discussions with stakeholders.

This shows at a very high level what the main user actions are across the service, and the role that different stakeholders might play at each of those interactions.

As part of this overview of the service, we have kept the service owner and admin deliberately separate from the rest of the actors, in order to show the additional actions that whoever administers this scheme will need to be responsible for

### Version 4

During Sprint 3, we continued iterating the blueprint based on insights from additional stakeholder interviews and findings from the second round of user research.

As the blueprint grew in complexity, we split the original 3 phases into 6 main phases. This included dividing the pre-registration phase into 'Awareness' and 'Preparation' to distinguish between the various steps involved in communicating the scheme and users preparing for registration. Similarly, we split the post-registration phase into 'Confirmation', 'Operation', and 'Continuation' to capture all the steps and actions covered within them.

We focused our conversations around outstanding questions about compliance requirements and validation, leading us to continue exploring the possibility of a staggered rollout as a potential solution to these challenges. We formulated a new assumption (#29) related to this staggered approach and decided to test its viability by creating a version of the blueprint that adheres to this model, allowing us to gather feedback from stakeholders.

V4.2 follows a staggered approach, eliminating the stage for compliance validation and checks during Phase 1. Instead, the 'Awareness' and 'Preparation' phases are leveraged to educate users about their responsibilities and ensure they are ready for compliance enforcement during Phase 2.

This staggered approach is still under exploration and requires further refinement.
