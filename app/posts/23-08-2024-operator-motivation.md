## What we tried to achieve

We were aiming to speak to people who would be actual users of this service and understand what the drivers might be that would get them to register their short-term lets. We wanted to understand what might have the biggest influence on them, things that would ‘push’ them to register (i.e. fine, legal repercussions, etc.) or things that would ‘pull’ them to register (i.e. a digital badge, credibility or other benefits)

In doing this is would help us to learn more about a key assumption we had in this area;

> Assumption 3 - “We assume that operators won't register their properties unless there's a compelling reason to do so”

## How we tested our assumption: methods, validation, and rationale.

We primarily tested this assumptions in ‘Round 1’ of our testing. In round 1 we conducted 5 usability testing sessions with different operators. These sessions lasted one hour, during which participants were shown several different versions of start pages with different ‘compelling reasons’, they were also shown some mock ups of booking platform listing pages with a draft digital badge.

Revised versions of the ‘start page’ were also tested in rounds 2 and 3 of the usability testing, this happened as part of testing the whole journey. It should be noted that in rounds 2 and 3 typically only one version of the start page was shown to participants in a session.

## Creating the ‘start page’ prototypes

We prototyped 3 versions of a registration start page to test what would motivate an operator to register their short-term let. We used a ‘carrot’ and ‘stick’ approach (benefits and warnings) to see if there was something in particular that operators would respond to.

During testing sessions had a discussion guide to prompt conversations with the participant.

We were hoping to answer so questions the team had such as:

- How big an impact might receiving a registration number and digital badge have one whether they would register?
- How big an impact would the threat of receiving a fine of up to £2,500 per property have on whether they would register?
- Did the wording ‘criminal offence’ or ‘civil offence’ have any impact on participants, or would simply saying that the registration is required by law be a reason they might register?

The order in which the warning and benefits appeared on the page were also tested in this round, alternating between the warning (which was in bold and accompanied with a warning icon), appearing before the benefits in one option and and appearing after the benefits in the remaining two options.

## Creating the ‘listing page’ prototypes

We also mocked up 2 listing platform webpages (airbnb + sykes cottage) as an example to show how a registration badge and number could look like for operators when they have registered their short-term let and listed it on a platform of their choice. This was to give a visual to the benefits mentioned on the registration start page.

One badge followed a Visit-England “we’re good to go” style of branding, whilst the other had the GOV.UK Crown featured. The reason for including the crown was to test whether users would feel that having the crown featured gave a sense of officiality to the badge over one that may not be as recognised and to also test whether this would serve as an encouragement to prompt the user to register their short-term let.

Both badges were shown in 2 different locations on the platform pages to see if there was a preference on placement. It is important to note that technical feasibility was not considered in this round, and the placement of the badges was merely for the users to 100% notice the badge and see if this is of benefit to them. Anything that would involve changing the structure of a booking platforms site would need to be investigated with the booking platforms themselves.

## Findings from user testing [CONTENT STILL BEING REVIEWED]

Our 5 usability testing sessions in round 1 gave several interesting insights on what might motivate operators to register for a short-term lets registration scheme.

Below are some details on the key findings from round 1 which related to Assumption 3(“We assume that operators won't register their properties unless there's a compelling reason to do so”).

### Round 1 findings and resulting decisions

#### Overall start page content

- Overall, people want to do the right thing, so they see the benefit in the scheme as a whole. This may be enough of a 'compelling reason' for them to register their short term let. However people's reasons to comply are very personal and they are compelled by different things (e.g. (personal/political beliefs/morals, financial drivers, their specific circumstances as an operator, etc).
  > **Which informed refinement of content on start page for R2 testing**
- On the other hand, despite being shown different benefits and warnings some were not compelled to register by either approach which leans on the assumption that some people will always avoid registering until they are forced too.

#### Warning content

- There were lots of comments around 'aggressive' or hostile language/tone leading to anxiety, fear and other negative emotions, the words 'Criminal', big fine etc were some examples of words that were seen as aggressive.
  > **Which informed refinement of content of the warning on start page for R2 testing**
- Not being able to use platforms acted as a push for the more experienced hosts or those that use their short-term let as a primary income, though the one prospective operatorin the testing did not reference this point directly within testing.
  > **Informed the decision to make sure this point is made up front, ideally in the warning message**

#### Benefits content

- When reading through the content on the registration start page, many participants did not immediately notice or understand the 'digital badge' or its intended benefits.
- Some people missed the reference to the badge entirely whilst some misinterpreted its purpose or how it might work. Only 1 participant saw how that benefit might have a positive impact on them.

#### Listing pages

- When participants were shown the badge on the mocked up platform listing pages (airbnb/sykes cottages) it was understood however the perceived overall value varies.
- All of those that previously didn't understand the badge (on the start page) were able to understand once seeing it on a listing page.
- Some saw it as a perk of registering or it might increase their likelihood to register to a smaller extent. But no-one saw it as a driving factor to register.
- If someone already has a strong negative perception of the registration scheme (i.e. fine, 'criminal', blocked from platforms) the concept of the badge was seen as insufficient to sway their opinion.

#### General findings

- Operators might be more compelled to register if there were a more tangible commercial benefit, examples given from participants included having better placement on listing results, having a portal to link up with registered guests and obtaining a 'better quality of guest'.
- Personal credibility, and to a lesser extent improving the credibility of the sector was also somewhat of a pull for participants register as it makes it more apparent who is reputable and helps improve the standards in the sector

### Round 2 findings and resulting decisions

## What happened next

#### Following the research findings:

We had a discussion with the policy team, we changed the language within one of the warnings content from an operator not registering their short term let being a “criminal offence” to “civil offence” this was after checking with the policy lawyer on what would be the most realistic repercussion(?)
