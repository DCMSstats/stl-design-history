title: How do operators learn about their short-term rental responsibilities?
date: 2024-10-08

## What we tried to achieve

We wanted to understand the steps that operators take when they start (or are considering starting) running a short-term let. Specifically we wanted to know more about:

* How much information they sought when they began (or were considering beginning) operating a short-term let

* What type of information they sought when they began (or were considering beginning) operating a short-term let

* What resources they used

* How they found these resources (i.e. Google, friends, word of mouth)

* Whether they still used any of those resources now

* What they thought were the biggest challenges or risks with operating a short-term let

* What they would have liked to have known before they started

* How familiar they were with the different responsibilities they have as a short-term let operator (e.g. guest wellbeing and safety)

Learning more about this would allow us to understand more about **Assumption 13** **(*“We assume that prospective/new operators follow a similar process when finding out their short-term let responsibilities”)***

## **How we tested our assumption: methods, validation, and rationale**

### Our testing approach

We tested this assumption across the three rounds of testing conducted with any participant who had been running a short-term let(s) for 12 months or less, or who owns a property that could be used as a short-term let but are not currently using it for that purpose. Over the course of the testing, this equated to 6 of the 15 participants.

At the beginning of each session, we conducted a semi-structured interview where we asked participants about themselves and the short-term lets that they operated. For operators who had been running their short-term lets for less than 12 months, we then followed up with questions to understand the process they followed when they started out. An example of our Round 1 discussion guide is shown below:

#### Introductory Questions (5 Minutes)

General questions on short-term lets:

“To begin, we’d like to understand a bit about you and your short-term lets, so…

1. Tell us about your short-term lets
   1. Prompts
      1. How long have you run a short-term let for?\*
      2. Where is your short-term let located?\*
      3. Who manages your short-term let?
      4. Why did you decide to start running a short-term let?
      5. What is your favourite thing about owning a short-term let?
      6. What are some of the biggest challenges you face as a short-term let owner?\*

   \*if not answered by Q1, ensure that this prompt is asked



#### **Pre-registration journey**

“As someone who has not long started running a short-term let, we’d like to understand a bit more about what you did when you decided to start running a short-term let. If you can cast your mind back to before you started…

2. How did you find out what to do to start a short-term let?
   1. What resources did you use?
   2. How did you find them (i.e. Google, friends, word of mouth)?
   3. Do you still use any of these resources now?
3. What did you see as the biggest challenges or risks when you were thinking of starting?
4. What would you have liked to have known before you started?
5. How familiar were you with the different responsibilities you might have as a short-term let owner? e.g. wellbeing/safety of your guests

The findings from our usability testing sessions can be found in the [‘Our findings’](#our-findings) section below.

## Our findings

### Findings from usability testing sessions with operators

#### 1\. Doing research is an almost universal behaviour of prospective and new short-term let operators

All but one of the participants explained that they undertook some sort of research. The exception was one participant who stated that they "learnt on the job" and also that they relied heavily on their prior experience in the tourism and hospitality sector.

There were some common themes on the types of information that people were looking for; these included:

* background information on the short-term let sector
* information on legislation
* marketing advice
* financial implications

*"I'd just find out what the norm is really"*

##### Resulting service design and prototype design suggestions:

* Introduce some additional advice pages on GOV.UK, for example "Everything you need to know to set up a short-term let"; or signpost to trusted external information from sources such as The Professional Association of Self-Caterers UK (PASC).
* If possible, signpost prospective operators to local/regional resources or organisations who may be able to provide support or answers to their questions.

#### 2\. Online is the channel of choice for prospective and new short-term let operators conducting research into the sector

All of our participants relied on search engines to gain information when entering the sector. Unsurprisingly, participants expect the most relevant information to appear at the top of their search results. Other means of finding information were via booking platforms and government websites; however this behaviour was less widespread than the use of search engines.

A few participants mentioned knowing that they should be careful of where they get their information from. In the main our participants said that they felt information on government pages would be the most trustworthy source.

*"If I can't find it on google I assume I don't need to know it"*

*"If a GOV.UK page appeared on the first page (of search results), I would read it. I trust them. You look at them for the facts."*

##### Resulting service design and prototype design suggestions:

* Ensure any government advice and guidance pages on short-term lets are consistently near or at the top of relevant search results.

#### 3\. Other 'sources' of information are friends and family, and professional organisations.

As well as finding material online, prospective and new short-term let operators also rely on the experience and expertise of those already in the sector. Our testing showed us that prior to entering the sector they will speak with friends and family, as well as professionals that work in, or are associated with, the sector. Several gave examples of how they had spoken to friends who had gone down a similar path and how they found their guidance valuable.

*"got a friend that rents on Airbnb, swears by it"*

##### Resulting service design and prototype design suggestions:

* Have a mechanism in any new GOV.UK guidance to direct prospective and new operators to trusted external partners, organisations or other arms-length bodies who can provide additional advice such as PASC or the Short Term Accommodation Association (STAA).

## What happened next

* Conversations are ongoing around creating new government guidance pages on short-term letting on GOV.UK, and an initial page has been prototyped, though not tested yet. The prototype page includes signposts to further guidance on PASC and STAA websites. Page content and design will need further development and testing in Beta.
* Exploration is also needed in Beta around a search engine optimisation strategy for these guidance pages.
