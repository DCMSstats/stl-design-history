# Design history for the Short Term Lets Service

A place for the Short Term Lets team to document service designs and decisions. We have hosted the site using Github Pages.
To view this site use this link [https://dcmsstats.github.io/stl-design-history/](https://dcmsstats.github.io/stl-design-history/)

## Purpose of this project

This repository is based on the original x-govuk design template which makes it easy to:

- screenshot your designs
- create pages of screenshots to document designs
- document designs using the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)
- print pages of designs
- make designs shareable and linkable

## Installation and getting started

Read this guide on how to [set up a design history](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-design-history/get-started/).

## Support

This project has been set up using the x-govuk/govuk-design-history-template which is maintained by a small number of volunteers working across government.

If there are questions about using a design history for our service, which can't be resolved by our team, we can report bugs or send feedback via, [submit a new issue](https://github.com/x-govuk/govuk-design-history-template/issues/new).

## Technical notes

The design history uses the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk) and the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) static site generator with the [GOV.UK Eleventy Plugin](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-eleventy-plugin/).
